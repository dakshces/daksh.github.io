I am a second-year math Ph.D. student at Brown University. Earlier, I studied mathematics and computer science at Grinnell College, Iowa, advised by Prof. Jennifer Paulhus and Prof. Nicole Eikmeier. I also spent my senior year in the Budapest Semesters in Math program. 

My email is [first\_name]\_[last\_name]@brown.edu.

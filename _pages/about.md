I am a second-year math Ph.D. student at Brown University. Earlier, I studied mathematics and computer science at Grinnell College, Iowa, advised by [Prof. Jennifer Paulhus](https://paulhus.math.grinnell.edu/index.html) and [Prof. Nicole Eikmeier](https://eikmeier.sites.grinnell.edu). I also spent my senior year in the Budapest Semesters in Math program, and I highly recommend it. 

My publications and preprints can be found [here](https://dakshces.github.io/publications/). My email is [first\_name]\_[last\_name]@brown.edu.
